# esx_carthief
## Description [EN]
Car theft script for ESX FiveM servers. Players can steal a car which they will have to deliver to a location to get some dirty money.

Note: This is NOT a job. This is an illegal activity anyone can do.
## Setup
* Install into resources/[esx]
* Add the following line to your server.cfg
```
start esx_carthief
```
* If you want to change the stolen vehicle location update time, you have to set `Config.BlipUpdateTime` to whatever time you would like in milliseconds in `config.lua`.

## Update 
- The location of the stolen car will not be shown to the police.
- Added the Italian language
- removed esx_policejob dependency, it works even without it
